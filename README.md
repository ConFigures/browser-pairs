This is a simplified version of a HTML5 pairs game originally created by the Mozilla Taiwan Community. This version has been modified to fit on
screens with smaller resolutions, and comments have been added to make the code more self-explanatory.

where I came across the Book Covers version of this game (from which I forked).

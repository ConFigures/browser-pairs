How To Modify This Game 
============
After I read [CREATING A MOZILLA WORKSHOP FOR BEGINNER HACKING OF MOBILE HTML5 GAMES](http://lukasblakk.com/creating-a-mozilla-workshop-for-beginner-hacking-of-mobile-html5-games/), I figured out how to personalize and play my own version of a simple image-matching game.  The best part is, GitHub provides hosting capability and the repository I forked from was already set up to use it, so once I'd made my changes, I was able to play it right away in a web browser, on my smartphone, or on my tablet, just by browsing to [the GitHub-hosted page for it](http://configures.github.com/browser-pairs/).  If you want to create your own version of the game, all you need to do is 
1.  Create a GitHub account (or log in to your existing account).  
2.  Browse to [this repository for the game](https://github.com/ConFigures/browser-pairs).
3.  Click the "Fork" button near the top right to create a new repository based on mine, in your own account.
4.  Select the index.html file.
5.  Click the "Edit" button and change the title to whatever you want to show in the browser tab when someone brings up your game in a web browser
6.  Click the "Commit Changes" button (this also begins GitHub backend operations to host your game)
7.  Edit the style.css file to change the background-image URL to an image you'd like to display on the background of your game.  Then edit the 8 background URLs further down in the file to images you want to display on the backs of the cards in the game.  
8.  Commit the changes.  
9.  Edit the README.md file to whatever you want to say on the landing page for your repository.  
10. Commit the changes.

Now you should be able to play your game at http://youraccountname.github.io/browser-pairs/!  Of course there's much more you can do if you want.  For instance, because I wasn't sure about intellectual property aspects, I just used some photos I'd already posted on my personal website.  Next I want to crop the images so they'll display better for the game (it autosizes so I don't have to be exact), and add a few more.  There are also other parts of the style.css that could be customized, and you could change the sounds that play.  What's more, you could use your game as a springboard to learn more about CSS, HTML5, Javascript, or Git.   There are [other web games hosted on GitHub](https://pinboard.in/u:configures/t:game+cm) you could play around with, too!
